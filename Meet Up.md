# Meetup Event Review

#### By Frank Ngo


- What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?
  - The event was "Why Everybody Hates Forms".  It was on Tuesday March 6th 2018.

- Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?
  - The event was hosted by the organization Portland Accessibility and User Experience Meetup.  It was hosted by members Josh H. , Eliza G., and Verne L. The guest speaker for the event was Gerry Gaffney who leads Information & Design, a usability consultancy in Melbourne Australia.  He also runs a podcast called User Experience and is co-author of the book "Forms that Work"

- What was the format of the event?
  - The format for this event was a short meet and greet, and a little bit of networking for first 30 minutes and then Gerry's presentation until the end.  

- What was the topic or main focus of the event?
  - The main topic for this event was UX and UI design.  Specifically an in depth look into understanding the issues with forms.  

- What made you want to attend this particular event?
  - What made me want to come to this event was my interest in front end, UX, and UI design.  Before coming to Epicodus all the programming work I had done was in a terminal/command prompt. Epicodus was the first time I was able to work with the an interface and from then on I loved working on it.  I want to be able to eventually have great UI to compliment any back end coding I have on my applications.  The reason I attended this meet up as well as other front end orientated meet ups is to try and improve my skill and understanding in front end, UX, and UI design.  

- What was the highlight of the event?
  - The highlight of this event was the presentation given by Gerry. The key points were examples of websites/ web apps that have forms that convey a good user experience and sites that do not. The other point that I think was a highlight of his seminar was his bit on understanding the relationship between user and form.

- What did you learn from this experience?
  - The main point I learned from this experience is that while forms are prevalent and often times required in websites/ web apps these days there are many right and wrong ways to have a form. A poor form always leads to a frustrating user experience while a good form leads to a great user experience regardless of the users ability. Another point Gerry brought up in regards to forms was thinking about users and more specifically a users ability spectrum.  Different sites and apps are going to have different users and depending on the users you will be having different form designs work better then others.  Or if the site might be used by a larger range of people going with a simple form design also leads to a good user experience.

- If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events do send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)
  - Overall I didn't have any feedback I would give back to the coordinators.  It was a seminar type meet up so it was expected to be more of a sit and listen type of event.  And it was just that.

- Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?
  - I would definitely recommend this event to any of my peers interesting in working on their front end design.  Other then that if one primarily works on back end then I would not recommend this meetup or any meet ups similar.
